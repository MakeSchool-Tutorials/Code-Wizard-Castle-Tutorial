- if statements
- loops

You are well on your way to becoming a Master Code Wizard.

Best of luck in your future code adventures!

## Bonus Challenges

You've completed the tutorial, but can you complete all of the bonus challenges below?

# Challenge 1 (Easy)

Make the `pet` change directions **before** it runs in the edge of the canvas so it doesn't look like it's walking into the walls.

# Challenge 2 (Easy)

Further customize the appearance of your castle by modifying more functions in `drawFunctions.js`

# Challenge 3 (Hard)

Add a new `pet` type by adding it to the array in `transformPetSpell()`, creating a new `drawName()` function for it, and modifying the `if` statement in `drawPet()` to call your new function

# Challenge 4 (Hard)

You may have noticed that if you levitate the broom and then leave the kitchen area that the broom stays levitated while you cast other spells.

Modify `updateCurrentSpell()` so that whenever `broom.levitate` is `true` the `.currentSpell` stays assigned to `levitateBroomSpell()`. That way you can drop the `broom` even if you move between rooms.

# Challenge 5 (Hardest)

Come up with your own totally unique customization of the Code Wizard Castle and share it with us!
