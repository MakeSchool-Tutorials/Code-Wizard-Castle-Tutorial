Congratulations, you've done it! You've completed the first steps on your Code Wizard journey.

In this tutorial, you've worked with many of the fundamental building blocks of programming:
- variables
- objects
- functions
- conditional logic
- if statements
- loops

You are well on your way to becoming a Master Code Wizard. Best of luck in your future code adventures!

## Bonus Challenges
### Easier
- Make the `pet` change directions *before* it runs in the edge of the canvas so it doesn't look like it's walking into the walls.
- Further customize the appearance of your castle by modifying functions in `drawFunctions.js`

### Harder
- Add a new `pet` type by adding it to the array in `transformPetSpell()`, creating a new `drawName()` function for it, and modifying the `if` statement in `drawPet()` to call your new function
- You may have noticed that if you levitate the broom and then leave the kitchen area that the broom stays levitated while you cast other spells. Modify `updateCurrentSpell()` so that whenever `broom.levitate` is `true` the `.currentSpell` stays assigned to `levitateBroomSpell()` so that you can drop the `broom` even if you move between rooms.
